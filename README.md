### Install From PIP :

You need to install a number of libraries to execute the script that you can use the following commands if you want to install them as each.

#### Install With `PIP` in Windows

```bash
pip install typing
pip install colorthon
pip install requests
pip install hdwallet
```
or `pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Install With `PIP3` in Linux

```bash
pip3 install typing
pip3 install colorthon
pip3 install requests
pip3 install hdwallet
```
or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You should do the installation steps of installing libraries only if you do not install only once for the first time and to use the script next time you do not need to be executed and installed with high commands. Just need to enter the following command.

- Windows : `python btcburt.py`
- Linux : `python3 btcburt.py`
